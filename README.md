# Auth0 Pizza 42

This sample demonstrates how to login in with a Pizza App. Once logged in, the user's profile will be available and be able to order pizza using the app. There will be OAuth so the customer doesn't have to repeat the login sequence. 
 1. Sign in using Google
 2. Once Signed in, click on the profile to retrieve user information
 3. Click on Ping to retrieve Pizza 42 API information with regards to total number of users. The public button is available for all users but only internals can see information from the private button

Hope you enjoy the experience!
